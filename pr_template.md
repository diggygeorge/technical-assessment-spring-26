## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interesting and beautiful frontend design with a catchy title and cool fonts and colors that looks good on any screen size.
- [x] A home page with a summary about the interesting thing you want to teach me about. I was originally planning for this to be purely academic (e.g. math, CS, physics, engineering) topics but I am expanding it to include anything. However, you should be able to teach about whatever you choose in a clear way and go in-depth about it. If your subject matter is particularly engaging, that will reflect positively on your application.
- [x] Extra pages with more detailed information on certain topics. Make your website intuitive to navigate through, both within the pages themselves and in your choice of pages. You can structure your website however you see fit.
- [x] A poll/quiz feature where you can check that the user is aborbing the information your website teaches about well. These quiz questions should be scattered throughout the website, and they should tell the user whether they got the answer right or not once they select it. Additionally, it should show a live count of results (like a social media poll) with the names of the users who have voted for each option. You should take time to make sure your UI for this component is intuitive to use while still including all of the features listed. A user should be able to change their result if they want, and this should be reflected in the result count.
- [x] A comment feature on each page where users can offer feedback or ask questions based on the lesson on the page. The home page does not need a comment section, but every other page should have one.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

I thought the project was really fun to implement.  Even though I have been using Next.js and Typescript for past projects and websites, I still found myself very engaged and I still was able to learn more about how React worked through this assessment.  That said, I found it enjoyable trying to figure out what eaxctly to use in order to implement the name feature, especially without authentication.  Since I realized that authentication could be overkill for this website, I tried to figure out how to save variables across multiple pages, which is how I came across useContext.  Using that was certainly interesting to figure out and I can definitely see myself use this feature more often in future projects.  I also had prior experience with MongoDB, so I used that extensively to implement the comment and quiz/poll features.  But this project in particular made me put a little more thought into how I should structure my database, especially if I want to retrieve multiple comments to one person or generate a randomized question.

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

Not really.  I moreso expected something a little more than a portfolio website (imagine this exact assessment but removing the comment and quiz/poll feature entirely).  But I'm glad this included aspects that were not entirely covered in the JDT workshops, so I could explore the features I specifically wanted to put in my website.  If I had an extra two weeks, I would also add more transitions to each of the pages, to make sure that the user experience is improved a little it.  I would also experiment with more creative layouts for each of the pages.  I would also figure out a way to add user-specific stats (e.g. You answered 75% of the questions right).  I would also try to implement a system where I could point users to the nearest karate dojos based on their geolocation so they could start training (or if they're unable to, point them to a bunch of online content where they start training).
